edit vars/main.yml with your username and password for AD
current files/sssd.conf file contains px1 information - edit for at4 or se3
run as root as svc_ansible is an AD user
ansible-playbook -i inventory main.yml -u root -k 
I then did this (getting svc_ansible in your copy buffer is recommended unless you like to type a lot):
for i in `cat inventory`; do ssh-copy-id ${i}; done
and then to confirm it worked with:
for i in `cat inventory`; do ssh -f ${i} "hostname"; done

todo:
refactor and move files into templates, adjust copy module accordingly to template module and src path

ansiblize the svc_ansible account ssh-copy-id

protect/obfuscate the user/pass variables for domain joining
